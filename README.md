# CS-800-Independent-Research Curriculum

The curriculum is divided into 12 chapters - each of which are intended to be completed in 1 week :
**WARNING**:At Week 8 - an assesment of the weekly progresion will be made, to update the curriculum plan according to the pace 

## 16 Week Plan : *(~ 1 Chapter per week)*
- [Chapter 0: Auto Differentiation](0-MicroGrad.md)
- [Chapter 1: Transformers](1-Transformers.md)
- [Chapter 2: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 3: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 4: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 5: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 6: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 7: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 8: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 9: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 10: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 11: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 12: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 13-16: TODO](TODO.md)


## Each chapter has three main sections:

- **Main Paper**: A small amount of material covering the most basic or important ideas of the chapter. Often a particular section of a paper will be singled out, and it's not necessary to read the rest of the paper.
- **Summary of Paper** My personal notes on the Main Paper.
- **Code/Model Implimentation**: An implimentation of the model described by the Chapter's main paper.

- **BONUS: Optional reading**: Related material that's still very relevant to the chapter, but can be either skimmed or skipped entirely and used as a reference later on.



## Alternative Usefull Sources

Some textbook suggestions:

- [Goodfellow et al](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - Probably still the best deep learning-specific textbook, although it can be unclear in places. Has no exercises.
- [Jared Kaplan's notes for physicists](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/files/2019/04/ContemporaryMLforPhysicists.pdf) - An extended introduction to deep learning from a fairly theoretical perspective. Also has no exercises.
- [Sutton & Barto](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) - A good introduction to reinforcement learning from first principles. Has exercises.
- [Murphy](https://www.google.com/search?q=machine+learning+a+probabilistic+perspective), [Bishop](https://www.google.com/search?q=pattern+recognition+and+machine+learning) and [ESL](https://www.google.com/search?q=elements+of+statistical+learning) - Classic machine learning textbooks. These cover a lot of material that isn't that relevant to deep learning, but it can be nice to have a broader perspective, and they have plenty of exercises. Overall they wouldn't be my first choice but they can be useful.

Some suggestions for more advanced online courses:

- [Deep Learning Specialization from deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/deep-learning-specialization/) - A much longer extension of the machine learning Coursera course linked above.
- [Deep Learning Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) - Another longer deep learning course.
- [Reinforcement Learning Coursera course](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/reinforcement-learning/index.html) - A reinforcement learning course based on Sutton & Barto.

## Additional advice

These are miscellaneous opinions based on personal experience, so take them with a pinch of salt. [An Opinionated Guide to ML Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html) is also worth a read.
