# CS-800-Independent-Research Curriculum

The curriculum is divided into 12 chapters - each of which are intended to be completed in 1 week :
**WARNING**:At Week 8 - an assesment of the weekly progresion will be made, to update the curriculum plan according to the pace 

## 16 Week Plan : *(~ 1 Chapter per week)*
- [Chapter 0: Auto Differentiation](0-MicroGrad.md)
- [Chapter 1: Transformers](1-Transformers.md)
- [Chapter 2: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 3: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 4: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 5: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 6: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 7: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 8: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 9: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 10: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 11: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 12: TODO](TODO.md)
- [Chapter 13-16: TODO](TODO.md)


## Each chapter has three main sections:

1. **Main Paper**: A single Main Paper will be singled out, to be studied in depth and implimented. Must read in enteirty and compose summart/deep-dive. 
2. **Summary of Paper** My personal summary/notes on the Main Paper.
3. **Code/Model Implimentation**: An implimentation of the model described by the Main Paper.

- **BONUS: Optional reading**: Related material that's still very relevant to the chapter, but can be either skimmed or skipped entirely and used as a reference later on.



## Usefull Sources

TextBooks:

- [Goodfellow et al](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - Probably still the best deep learning-specific textbook, although it can be unclear in places. Has no exercises.
- [Jared Kaplan's notes for physicists](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/files/2019/04/ContemporaryMLforPhysicists.pdf) - An extended introduction to deep learning from a fairly theoretical perspective. Also has no exercises.


Online courses:

- [Deep Learning Specialization from deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/deep-learning-specialization/) - A much longer extension of the machine learning Coursera course linked above.
- [Deep Learning Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) - Another longer deep learning course.

## Additional advice

These are miscellaneous opinions based on personal experience, so take them with a pinch of salt. [An Opinionated Guide to ML Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html) is also worth a read.
