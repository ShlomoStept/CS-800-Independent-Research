# CS-800-Independent-Research Curriculum

The curriculum is divided into 12 chapters - each of which are intended to be completed in 1 week :
- At Week 8 : we will reasses the progression and update the curriculum plan accordingly 

- [Chapter 0: Auto Differentiation](0-MicroGrad.md)
- [Chapter 1: Transformers](1-Transformers.md)


Each chapter has three sections:

- **Recommended reading**: A small amount of material covering the most basic or important ideas of the chapter. Often a particular section of a paper will be singled out, and it's not necessary to read the rest of the paper.
- **Optional reading**: Related material that's still very relevant to the chapter, but can be either skimmed or skipped entirely and used as a reference later on.
- **Summary of Paper** My personal notes on the Main Paper.
- **Code/Model Implimentation**: An implimentation of the model described by the Chapter's main paper.

Each chapter should take between half a week and 2 weeks of full-time study, depending on the chapter and how much depth you go into, but don't be discouraged if it takes longer than this.




## Alternative Usefull Sources

Some textbook suggestions:

- [Goodfellow et al](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) - Probably still the best deep learning-specific textbook, although it can be unclear in places. Has no exercises.
- [Jared Kaplan's notes for physicists](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/files/2019/04/ContemporaryMLforPhysicists.pdf) - An extended introduction to deep learning from a fairly theoretical perspective. Also has no exercises.
- [Sutton & Barto](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) - A good introduction to reinforcement learning from first principles. Has exercises.
- [Murphy](https://www.google.com/search?q=machine+learning+a+probabilistic+perspective), [Bishop](https://www.google.com/search?q=pattern+recognition+and+machine+learning) and [ESL](https://www.google.com/search?q=elements+of+statistical+learning) - Classic machine learning textbooks. These cover a lot of material that isn't that relevant to deep learning, but it can be nice to have a broader perspective, and they have plenty of exercises. Overall they wouldn't be my first choice but they can be useful.

Some suggestions for more advanced online courses:

- [Deep Learning Specialization from deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/deep-learning-specialization/) - A much longer extension of the machine learning Coursera course linked above.
- [Deep Learning Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) - Another longer deep learning course.
- [Reinforcement Learning Coursera course](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/reinforcement-learning/index.html) - A reinforcement learning course based on Sutton & Barto.

## Additional advice

These are miscellaneous opinions based on personal experience, so take them with a pinch of salt. [An Opinionated Guide to ML Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html) is also worth a read. For advice on pursuing a career in technical AI alignment, I recommend [this guide](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WXPkpqKGKewAymJf/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment).

I've emphasized exercises throughout this page, because they force you to think ideas through in a way that passive learning doesn't. In my experience, this is especially important when learning about unfamiliar topics. Once you have built up experience in an area, it's much easier to remember something in that area that you've only seen or heard once, because of how it fits into your existing web of knowledge.
